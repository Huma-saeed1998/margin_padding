        since atoms as a whole are electrically neutral and very much heavier than electron, 
        there immediately arose the problem; how the compensating positive charge and the bulk of the mass is 
        distributed within an atom? Thomson himself imagined that electrons were embedded in positively charged 
        paste like "the plumps in a pudding".
